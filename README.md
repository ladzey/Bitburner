# Bitburner
Newbie Script for Bitburner

# What is it?
advancedstart.js - This script automates the process of deploying a set of hacking scripts to every server on your network (except for servers you want to exclude, such as "home").

remove.js - This script is designed to clean up your network by stopping and removing specific script files from every server (except those you want to keep intact).
