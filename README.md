# Bitburner
Newbie Script for Bitburner

# What is it?
deploy.js - This script automates the process of deploying a set of hacking scripts to every server on your network, I implemented an exclusion server, maximum hops that you can adjust, and server filtering before copying scripts to the following servers.

remove.js - This script is designed to clean up your network by stopping and removing specific script files from every server, I implemented the same system as in deploy.js (without the server filtering).

# Disclaimer
